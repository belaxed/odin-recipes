Intro and Description: This project involves me creating a basic recipe website. By completing this project I will have demonstrated that I have a handle on basic HTML. This includes setting up the HTML boilerplate, using tags such as headers, paragraphs, unordered/ordered lists, hyperlinks, images, and more.
