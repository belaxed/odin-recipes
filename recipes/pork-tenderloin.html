    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup harissa paste or 1 teaspoon harissa spice powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 pork tenderloin (1 to 1¼ pounds), silver skin removed, meat halved crosswise and patted dry</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 375 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together the harissa and honey. On a plate, season the pork all over with salt and pepper (about 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or ½ teaspoon fine sea salt). Rub a thin layer of the harissa-honey mixture all over the pork and reserve the rest.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Add the pork and cook until very browned on two sides, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Decrease the heat if the pork is burning; hold onto the plate.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and return the pork to the plate. Rub the pork all over with the remaining harissa-honey mixture. Remove any burnt bits from the skillet, then return the pork to the skillet and roast until a thermometer in the thickest part registers between 140 and 145 degrees, 8 to 12 minutes. (The thinner, tapered piece of meat may be ready first, so check both pieces and remove them as they’re done.)</li>
        <li>Transfer to a cutting board to rest at least 10 minutes (the meat’s internal temperature will continue to climb), then slice and serve with the juices poured over.</li>
    </ol>
